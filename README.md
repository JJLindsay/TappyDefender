# TappyDefender

This is an AGP By Example Android project that I will be working through.
<br/>When it is finished, it will be a Flappy Bird clone.

<b>Current State:</b>
-Added a HUD which displays speed, time, shield, and distance. The numbers in place are just placeholders.
-The collision box is still visible for debugging purposes.

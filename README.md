This is an AGP By Example Android project that I will be working through.
<br/>When it is finished, it will be a Flappy Bird clone.

<b>Current State:</b>
<ul>
	<li>
		More enemy variety
	</li>
	<li>
		The enemies scale in height depending on the device display size
	</li>
	<li>
		More enemies based on display size
	</li>
	<li>
		The sound is crappy and the SoundPool is not great. I'm considering alternatives.
	</li>
	<li>
		Improved the display of time
	</li>
	<li>
		Should the user press the Back button, the game will call finish.
	</li>
</ul>

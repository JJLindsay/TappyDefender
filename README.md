# TappyDefender

This is an AGP By Example Android project that I will be working through.
<br/>When it is finished, it will be a Flappy Bird clone.

Current State:
<br/>- When a player collides with an enemy the enemy is removed fromt the screen. For debugging purposes, the collision box is visible.

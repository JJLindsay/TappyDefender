# TappyDefender

This is an AGP By Example Android project that I will be working through.
<br/>When it is finished, it will be a Flappy Bird clone.

Current State:
-The player now moves automatically across the screen when the game starts up. 
-Holding down on the screen makes the player move faster and glide up,
releasing causes the player to fall and slow down.
-3 enemies populate the screen.
-Star dust fills the background.

NOTE: collision detection is not in place... yet.
